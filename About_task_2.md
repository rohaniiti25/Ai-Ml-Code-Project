## 1. Get Ready
🛠️ Load all the computer tools we need

Make sure we can read sound files and build AI brains

## 2. Organize Your Sounds 📁
Look for folders with sounds (like "dog/", "car/")

Take each sound and turn it into a "sound picture" (spectrogram)

Make all pictures the same size

Remember which category each sound belongs to

## 3. Build Two AI Brains 🧠
🎨 The Creator:

Takes random noise + a category (like "dog")

"Draws" new sound pictures

Tries to make them look real

🔍 The Detective:

Looks at real and fake sound pictures

Guesses which ones are real

Learns to spot fakes

## 4. The Training Game 🎯
Round 1 - Train Detective:

Show real pictures → "This is real!"

Show fake pictures → "This is fake!"

Detective learns the difference

Round 2 - Train Creator:

Make new fake pictures

Try to fool the Detective

Creator learns to make better fakes

Repeat - Both get smarter each round!

## 5. Make New Sounds 🔊
Tell Creator what category we want

It makes a new sound picture

Turn that picture back into real sound

Save as .wav file you can play

6. Show Progress 📊
Save new sound files every few rounds

Save pictures to see improvement

Watch the AI get better over time
